# Preface

Fairyland OCaml is a blog by [Shiwei Weng](https://www.prover.me/) to write my OCaml experience. I used to share OCaml snippet and understanding in our research group [JHU PL Lab](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/). I decided to port them here. The intuition often comes from my learning and research experience as well as fantastic students from two [functional](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/fpse/) [programming](https://pl.cs.jhu.edu/pl/) courses at JHU.

The blog name is obviously from [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/).
